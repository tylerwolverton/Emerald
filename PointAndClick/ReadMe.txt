Point and click template powered by Zephyr

How to Use
- Run PointAndClick_x64 to start the game. 

Keyboard
- WASD to move the player
- Esc -> Pause, press again to Exit game
- ~ -> Open dev console

Debug Commands
- F5 -> Reload all data files and restart game
- F6 -> Reload all script files only (warning, doing this can break certain script interactions like the door in level 1. The main use of this might be to debug some AI in a level, not to test larger game management functionality)
